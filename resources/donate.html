                Here’s the deal. I don’t need money. I’m happy to continue running this site and working on removing family court bias, with no donations at all. However, I can promise you that any donations provided will go towards the goal of correcting the family court system, or raising awareness for the problem. Some examples include:

                    Professionally developing this website (maybe even getting a proper domain name)
            </li>
            <li>
                    Working with other parents who have experienced similar bias to expose their stories as well

            <li>
                    Donating to organizations such as National Parents Organization
