                Here’s the deal. I don’t need money. I’m happy to continue running this site and working on removing family court bias, with no donations at all. However, I can promise you that any donations provided will go towards the goal of correcting the family court system, or raising awareness for the problem. Some examples include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                    Professionally developing this website (maybe even getting a proper domain name)
            </li>
            <li>
                    Working with other parents who have experienced similar bias to expose their stories as well
            </li>
            <li>
                    Donating to organizations such as National Parents Organization
            </li>
            <li>
                    Spending my time corresponding with legislators
            </li>
        </ul>

            Unfortunately, as I have decided to not reveal my identity publicly yet, Bitcoin is the only option. In the future I'll consider going public and having a PayPal and Patreon link. <br><br>
