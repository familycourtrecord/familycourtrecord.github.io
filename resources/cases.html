                My case is a simple one. There was no abuse, drugs, or any criminal activity at all involved. The short version is, I divorced my wife, finished out my contract with the Air Force, came home hoping to be an active parent in my kid’s life, and the court said no. In doing so they also ordered that I’m not allowed to have a say in how my kid is being educated. They also blatantly mispresented the facts of the case in ways that make me appear to be a horrible parent. While it’s not an exhaustive list of all the things wrong with my case you can get a good idea of the key elements by reading my official <a href="./Complaint.html">complaint</a> (if you are on mobile, click the "show simplified view" option) filed against the judge. The complaint links to the it several times, but if you’d prefer you can read the official <a href="./Judgment.html">Judgment</a> first. Finally, if you want a more narrative explanation of what happened, feel free to check out my blog post over on MenAreHuman.com.
