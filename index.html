            Welcome to my website. It's just starting out and will look more professional in the future. For now, it serves as a place to allow public viewing of the details regarding my case. If you feel you have been in a similar situation and would like to make the details of your case public, please contact me. I would consider transforming this website into a public repository for anyone who believes the family court has failed them and their child.
